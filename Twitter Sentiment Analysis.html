        <h1><u>Twitter Sentiment Analysis</u></h1>
    </header>
    <main>
    <p>This project involved processing and cleaning a substantial dataset of 31,962 tweets to enhance data quality for analysis. The initial step included applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to remove noise such as Twitter handles, punctuation, and special characters. This cleaning process also addressed inconsistencies and missing values in the data, leading to a more reliable dataset for subsequent analysis.</p>
    <p>For feature extraction, the project utilized Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF methods to convert the cleaned text data into numerical features. These techniques enabled effective sentiment analysis and hate speech detection by translating textual information into a format that machine learning algorithms can interpret. Additionally, libraries such as Pandas and Word2Vec were employed to further refine feature representation.</p>
    <p>To achieve comprehensive analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were integrated into the model. CNNs were used for feature extraction, while RNNs handled the sequential nature of tweet data. This combination allowed for thorough preprocessing and analysis, improving the model's accuracy and performance.</p>
