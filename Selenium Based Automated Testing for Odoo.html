        <h1><u>Selenium Based Automated Testing for Odoo</u></h1>

        <p>In this project, I engineered a comprehensive Selenium WebDriver script designed to automate end-to-end (E2E) testing for Odooâ€™s open-source module. The primary objective was to enhance the testing process by increasing test coverage and ensuring that the various features and functionalities of the module were thoroughly validated. This automation streamlined the testing process and ensured that all critical workflows were consistently tested, significantly improving the reliability of the module.</p> 
        <p>Additionally, I designed and implemented Python unit tests using the unit test framework. These tests were strategically focused on both regression and integration testing, which played a crucial role in identifying and addressing critical bugs early in the development phases. By catching issues early, we were able to reduce the number of critical bugs that reached later stages of development, thereby enhancing overall code quality and stability.</p>
        <p>To further boost the efficiency and reliability of the automated tests, I utilized Git for version control and employed PyCharm as the primary development environment. PyCharm's debugging and code profiling features were instrumental in refining the test scripts and ensuring their optimal performance. This approach not only streamlined the development workflow but also improved the overall accuracy and effectiveness of the automated testing process.</p>
